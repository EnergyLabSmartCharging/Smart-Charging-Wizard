# Smart Charging Wizard 
_A Lightweight User Interface for Cloud-based Smart Charging of Electric Vehicles_
_____________________
-  is a web app with a back end optimization module and a front end User Interface (UI). 

> TBD: motivation and short intro
- utilization of energy and time flexibilities in charging events of Electric Vehicles (EVs)


## What information do you have to put into the Smart Charging Wizard?
- desired time of departure
- desired SOC at departure
- specifications of EV
- applicable electricity tariff

> TBD: GIF of inputs

## What magic does the Smart Charging Wizard do?
- runs optimization scheme to minimize both battery aging costs and electricity costs
- considers dynamic behavior of the EV battery
- respects the constraints given by you (time and SOC) and the EV (battery capacity, charging power)

> TBD: GIF of starting calculation and result page

## What's behind the magic of the Smart Charging Wizard?
The following figure shows an overview of the IoT architecture and the participants in the context of the Smart Charging Wizard:

- EV user interacts with the Smart Charging Wizard via a smart device using HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)
- Smart Charging Wizard runs together with a Charging Session Handler (CSH) and a Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) server in a cloud environment
- MQTT server establishes communication between web app, CSH, and a Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) via JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) encoded messages
- For communication between the PLC and the charging station, we choose the User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
- The PLC sets the current at the charging station using the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 61851 standard, receives the charging stationâ€™s actual status and measurements, and forwards them via MQTT to the Smart Charging Wizard
